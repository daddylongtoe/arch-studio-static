          <p class="">
            The Seraph Station project challenged us to design a unique station
            that would transport people through time. The result is a fresh and
            futuristic model inspired by space stations.

          <p class="">
            A sequel theme project for a tower originally built in the 1800s. We
            achieved this with a striking look of brutal minimalism with modern
            touches.

          <p class="">
            Trinity Bank challenged us to make a concept for a 84 story building
            located in the middle of a city with a high earthquake frequency.
            For this project we used curves to blend design and stability to
            meet our objectives.
